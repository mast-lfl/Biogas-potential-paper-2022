# Biogas-potential-paper-2024

Public repository with parameter values used for a 2024 research article proposing a new framework for determining the technical biomass 
potential for biogas production within a bounded geographic region with high spatial resolution. The parameters were used to apply the 
framework to estimate the technical and the unused technical biogas potential in Bavaria as a case study. The parameters may be used for 
different purposes and geographic regions as well, however caution has to be applied whether the presented parameter values can be applied.
but may be used for different.
Presented volume data refers to 0 Â°C and 1,013.25 mbar.
