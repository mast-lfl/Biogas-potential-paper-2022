# Biogas-potential-paper-2024

Public repository with parameter values used for a 2024 paper proposing a new framework for determining the technical biomass potential
for biogas production within a bounded geographic region with high spatial resolution. The parameters were used to apply the framework
to estimate the technical and the unused technical biogas potential in Bavaria as a case study. The parameters may be used for different
purposes and geographic regions as well but caution has to be applied whether the parameter values can be applied.
but may be used for different
